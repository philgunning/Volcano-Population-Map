# Volcano Population Map
A folium based html map generating script, plotting volcanoes in USA, along with height and hyperlinks to google searches, and worldwide populations filtered by colour overlays. 

Nation borders added as polygons and filled based on country population info.
Volcanoes are colour dependant on elevation and have relevant info displayed as popups when clicked, including a link to a google search with that particular volcanoes name.
